  <h2>IMPORTANCE</h2>
  <p>
          Every museum object is unique, but items made of
          similar materials share characteristics. Museum
          Artifacts gives participants an understanding of the
          materials and processes used to make objects - knowledge
          that better prepares them to decide how tocare for their collections

    <h2>NEEDS OF MUSEUM IN SOCIETY</h2>
    <p>
                 Museums play a crucial role in preserving local culture.
                 With careful documentation and artifact preservation,
                 a culture can be recorded and remembered regardless of its
                future. It can also be shared and understood by those from
                different cultural backgrounds.
